\section{Materials and Methods}

To improve trap catch and monitoring of adult onion maggot fly, iterations of sticky traps of various shape, size, and color were evaluated in 2005 and 2006 in Upstate New York.  Additionally, after an improved shape, size, and color trap was developed, this trap was tested in conjunction with a Delia Lure attractant to evaluate potential improvement in trap catch.  

All trials were conducted in commercial fields on muck soil near Elba, NY in western upstate New York (\textbf{GPS coordinates, other information about unique muck characteristics?}).  No modifications were done to commercial weed, disease, or pest management and spray programs (which closely followed recommended management \citep{reiners2011integrated}), the primary target of which is \textit{Thrips tabaci}.  This management is unlikely to affect \textit{D. antiqua} populations due to spray timing and minimal impacts of thrips sprays on onion maggot fly \citep{finch1986behavior}. 

\subsection{Shape Trial}

To evaluate effect of trap shape on trap catch and monitoring of adult onion maggot fly, square, cube, short cylindrical, tall cylindrical, and spherical semi-gloss white shapes each with a surface area of 180 $cm^2$  were coated with sticky material (\textbf{Tanglefoot?}) and placed along the long edge of an onion (\textit{Allium cepa} L.) field near Elba, NY.  Traps were spaced 15.24 meters apart and arranged in a randomized control block design with five replications.  Traps were placed in the field in late May then collected in late June (\textbf{Not sure about this, more info needed?}).   

\subsection{Analysis}

Raw data from shape, size, and color trials were analyzed using linear models and analysis of variance.  Models were determined after consideration of all factor combinations and interactions and selected based on consideration of residual diagnostics (conformance to assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity), goodness of fit tests, $R^2$ values, information criteria, and leverage considerations. Based on these considerations, an outlier was detected and removed from the shape trials (P = 0.032, Bonferroni Outlier Test) and data from the size and color trials were square root transformed to conform with assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.    

Raw data from the Delia Lure Trial were analyzed with a paired t-test due to the nature of the experimental design.  Conformation to assumptions of normality were confirmed through examination of quantile-quantile plots.

\subsection{Data Management}

All data for the trials were entered into flat tabular (.csv) files.  All analysis on the raw data was conducted in R version 3.5.2 using RStudio as an IDE (with Vim keybindings) \citep{rcore2018,rstudio}.  The $tidyverse$, $car$, and $emmeans$ packages were used to facilitate analysis \citep{tidy, car, emmeans}.  All code, including manuscript documentation, is available on GitHub (https://github.com/acetworld/onion-maggot-attraction).

\subsection{Second Level Heading}
If data, scripts or other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the article are available via a publicly available data repository, please include a reference to the location of the material within the article.

% Equations should be inserted using standard LaTeX equation and eqnarray environments, not as graphics, and should be set in the main text
This is an equation, numbered
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{+\infty}e^{-x^2}dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}
And one that is not numbered
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\pi}=-1
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Adding Citations and a References List}

Please use a \verb|.bib| file to store your references. When using Overleaf to prepare your manuscript, you can upload a \verb|.bib| file or import your Mendeley, CiteULike or Zotero library directly as a \verb|.bib| file\footnote{see \url{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}}. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{lees2010theoretical}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a video tutorial here to learn more about BibTeX: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}.

This template provides two options for the citation and reference list style: 
\begin{description}
\item[Numerical style] Use \verb|\documentclass[...,num-refs]{wiley-article}|
\item[Author-year style] Use \verb|\documentclass[...,alpha-refs]{wiley-article}|
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}
Supporting information will be included with the published article. For submission any supporting information should be supplied as separate files but referred to in the text.

Appendices will be published after the references. For submission they should be supplied as separate files but referred to in the text.

\paragraph{Fourth Level Heading}

\subparagraph{Fifth level heading}
Measurements should be given in SI or SI-derived units.
Chemical substances should be referred to by the generic name only. Trade names should not be used. Drugs should be referred to by their generic names. If proprietary drugs have been used in the study, refer to these by their generic name, mentioning the proprietary name, and the name and location of the manufacturer, in parentheses.
